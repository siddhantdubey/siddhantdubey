### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Siddhant.

I'm currently focused on improving my system design and development skills by building projects that I'll use frequently. 

My interests include:
- Tools for Thought (things that make my creative life easier)
- Web Dev
- Compilers (Learning about these is on the to-do list)
- Machine Learning (Like every other programmer)
- Writing
- [Making Video Content](https://youtube.com/c/SiddhantDubey)

You can find out more about me on my [[personal blog]](https://siddubey.com/), I'll try to update it at least once every month.
